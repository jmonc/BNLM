# Stroke affected motor behaviour

Lab Assignment \#2

This assignment should be written in the form of a laboratory report. Your job is to compare the motor behaviour of rats before and after stroke. This is based on [Lab \#G1](../docs/movement_disorders_stroke/)

The data for this report will be pooled from all of the groups within your laboratory sections such that you will be able to run a statistical analysis for each of the behavioural analyses that were performed. **Your goal is to choose one or two relevant comparisons for each of the motor behaviours that you observed.**

Your paper should include a title page, abstract, introduction, methods section, results section, and a discussion. The assignment should be approximately 10-15 pages in length. Papers will be graded according to the rubric that follows the details of the assignment.

**Introduction** Your introduction should place your study in the larger context of stroke, the impact of stroke on behaviour, etc. This should include a justification as to why motor behaviour is important to study post-stroke.

**Methods** The methods section should describe in sufficient detail the methodologies employed in this week’s laboratory, as well as the surgical procedure that you observed.

**Results** Your results section should report your findings, including statistics and figures where appropriate. You may wish to report any unusual qualitative data should it pertain to your paper.

**Discussion** Here you should discuss the behaviours as you observed them, what went wrong, what you might improve \(if anything\), etc. The implications of stroke on behaviour should be discussed, as well as how your findings fit within the current body of research on the topic.
