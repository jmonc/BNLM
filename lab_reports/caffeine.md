# Water maze caffeine induced behaviour

Lab Assignment \#3

This assignment should be written in the form of a laboratory report. Your job is to compare the behaviour of rats exposed to caffeine \(800 mg/L in drinking water for 24h prior to, and during, testing\) to controls in the Morris water task and novel object preference task. The data for this report will be pooled from all of the groups within your laboratory sections such that you will be able to run a statistical analysis. Your paper should include a title page, abstract, introduction, methods section, results section, and a discussion. The assignment should be approximately 10-15 pages in length. Papers will be graded according to the rubric that follows the details of the assignment.

**Introduction** Your introduction should place your study in the larger context of memory research, and the influence that exposure to caffeine might have on memory ability.

**Methods** The methods section should describe in sufficient detail the methodologies employed for caffeine administration, the Morris water task, the novel object preference task, as well as the measures you have decided to analyze.

**Results** Your results section should report your findings, including statistics and figures where appropriate. You may wish to report any unusual qualitative data should it pertain to your paper.

**Discussion** Here you should discuss the behaviours as you observed them, what went wrong, what you might improve \(if anything\), etc. The implications of your findings should be discussed, as well as how your findings fit within the current body of research on the topic.
