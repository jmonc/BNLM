# How to contribute

The goal of this project is to provide an open source documentation, that any interested user can copy and adapt for their own requirements. The source files are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jmonc/BNLM) which may be freely downloaded.

For contributions and suggestions to the GitHub repository please contact us through...firstname.lastname@ucalgary.ca

## Editing options

The online version is hosted on [GitBook](https://behavioural-neuroscience-uofc.gitbook.io/lab-manual/) which an easy to use service for both readers and editors. It provides most services required by such as project as this. Extending the capabilities is possible but comes with complications and a larger learning curve. For example, plug-ins are restricted.

Although not used to directly edit the GitBook, GitHub is linked such that changes to one will sync to the other.

## GitBook

### Version control on GitBook

GitBook inherits a version control similar to GitHub. As the document is updated previous versions will remain accessible, ensuring that no information is lost due to problems, and the project can easily be reverted to a working older version.

GitBook provides a concise [documentation](https://docs.gitbook.com/content-editing) which covers the editing options available. 

Once the user has access, editing a page is simple. First press the blue "Start a new draft" button in the lower right. Any changes will be saved as a draft until the user is ready to either save the changes or discard the draft.

Once the draft is ready and saved, it can then be published or archived. It is highly recommended to give a short description of the changes, therefore making it easy to review past changes.

This can be done by editing the "Describe draft's changes" option, for example to "reformatted introduction". Once it is published, it will sync to the GitHub account with the new version and the changes will take effect on both sites.

Note that the design philosophy attempts to restrict the outright deletion of drafts and previous versions, rather they are archived for future reference.
