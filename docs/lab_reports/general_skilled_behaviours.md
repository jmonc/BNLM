Lab Assignment \#1

This assignment should be written in the form of a modified laboratory report (see below). Your job is to describe the general behaviours you observed in [Lab \#C](../general_adult_motor\general_adult_motor.md) and the skilled behaviours that you assessed in [Lab \#D](../skilled_adult_motor\skilled_adult_motor.md). Your paper should include a title page, abstract, introduction, methods section, results section, and a discussion. The assignment should be approximately 10-15 pages in length. Papers will be graded according to the rubric that follows the details of the assignment.

**Introduction**
Your introduction should review the basics of the general and skilled behaviours you have chosen to discuss. As well, the behaviours you have chosen should be placed in context; this includes what is currently understood regarding your topic.

**Methods**
The methods section should describe in sufficient detail the methodology you employed in this week’s laboratory for both of the behaviours you have chosen.

**Results**
Your results section should include a paragraph for each of the behaviours you have chosen to report. Since there are no experimental manipulations, basic observations of the behaviours are sufficient. Keep your data, as it will be important for future laboratory experiments.

**Discussion**
Here you should discuss the behaviours as you observed them, what went wrong, what you might improve (if anything), etc. Additionally, using PubMed as a resource (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed), include an in-depth analysis of a paper from the last five years that uses one of the skilled behaviours you have discussed in your paper. Include in your description what they are testing, how the behavioural assay is used (any modifications to the assay in comparison to how you ran it in class), the major findings from the study, the implications of the experiment, and any potential limitations, as well as a way to address those limitations.
