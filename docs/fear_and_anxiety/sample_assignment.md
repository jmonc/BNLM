# PSYC/NEUR 478 – Brief Assignment \#3

In this week’s lab you assessed the behaviour of rats in two tasks that are often used to assay fear and anxiety (elevated plus maze and open field). Your assignment is to perform a literature search on one of these tasks and find a paper that reports a change in the behaviour of rats or mice after an experimental manipulation. In no more than two double-spaced pages, summarize the paper, including its rational, its methods, and implications of the findings. Be sure to include references where appropriate.
