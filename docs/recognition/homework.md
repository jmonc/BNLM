# L. 1. Homework

* For the Delayed Nonmatching-to-Sample task, prepare a graph showing the percent correct for each retention interval.  Run an ANOVA to determine if percent correct changes significantly over the course of time.
* For the Novel-Object Preference task, calculate average exploration ratios each of the three minutes of the test, and prepare a summary graph.  An exploration ratio is the time spent exploring the novel object divided by the sum of the time spent exploring both the novel and sample object \(TNovel / \(Tnovel + TSample\).  A ratio of 0.5 would indicate that the objects were explored equally, while a ratio greater than 0.5 would indicate that the novel object was explored more.  Run three one-sample t-test to determine if the animals significantly discriminated at each of the one-minute blocks of the test session.  Run an ANOVA to determine if the exploration ratio changed over time.
