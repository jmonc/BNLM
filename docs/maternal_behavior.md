# Maternal Behavior

####Objectives:
*	To observe and describe a number of maternal behaviors in the female rat.
*	Compare the behavior of virgin female rats to the behavior of mother rats with respect to the pups.  

####Introduction:
Maternal behavior of the laboratory rat is a highly organized behavior that appears spontaneously in postpartum mother rats, but not in males or virgin females (Fleming and Rosenblatt, 1974; Jans and Woodside, 1990).  Important hormonal events during pregnancy lead to neural changes that prime a mother for maternal behaviors.  Maternal behavior is sensitive to various drugs, and as such, can be an important screen for therapeutic drugs that may alter human maternal behavior.  Post partum depression and infanticide can be tragic events for new families, and understanding the hormonal and neural changes that accompany maternal behavior is an essential foundation for decreasing the suffering experienced by some new mothers.

####Procedure:
*Preparation:*
Read Chapter 27: Maternal Behavior (Rees et al., 2005) before the lab this week.
A few weeks ago you studied sexual behavior in rats.  Hopefully this was a fruitful endeavor, providing you with pups to study for today’s lab.   Collect a cage with a mother and pups, a cage with a virgin female, and 2 clean empty cages.  Put on gloves before handling any pups.
*Test:*
**Observing Undisturbed Maternal Behavior**
To start, simply watch the mother in her home cage interacting with her pups.  First assess the quality of the nest (see Rees et al. (2005) page 290). Note the following behaviors: body licking, anogenital licking, and nursing.  Note the mother’s posture.  Observe the mother and litter for 30 minutes.

**Pup Retrieval**
Remove the pups to clean cage and place them in a huddle.  Remove the mother to a separate clean cage.  Wait 5 minutes.  Place the mother back in her home cage for 5 minutes and note her behavior.  Then place the pups back into their home cage in the corner diagonally opposite the nest.  Observe the mother’s retrieval behavior and time how long it takes for her to move all of the pups back to the nest.  Note any behaviors she performs on the pups in addition to carrying them.

**Virgin Female Response to Pups**
Remove both the pups and the mother back to their clean cages.  Place the virgin female in the cage with the nest.  Observe her behavior for 5 minutes.  Place the pups in their home cage in the corner diagonally opposite the nest.  Observe the virgin females response to the pups for 20 minutes.  If she attempts to injure any pups, remove her immediately and inform the TA.  At the end of the testing session, place the pups and some clean paper towel into the clean cage containing the mother and return the family to the colony room in this clean cage.  

####Homework Assignment:
*	In one page, describe licking, nursing, and pup retrieval behavior of the mother.
*	The virgin females’ behavior differed from the mothers.  What is the biological reason for this difference in behavior?  Search the literature for a study that examines the biological underpinnings of maternal behavior, and summarize this study (hypothesis, experimental design, findings and conclusions).
