# Behavioural Neuroscience Lab Manual

## Welcome!

This is an open access project created at the University of Calgary, with the goal of providing an online resource for a senior-level behavioural neuroscience laboratory course \(PSYC 478\). Included in the document are a number of laboratory activities and suggested student assessments.

The authors are indebted to those that have contributed to and provided feedback on several versions of the laboratory manual. Specifically we would like to acknowledge Dr. Brooke Rakai and Dr. Cam Teskey for their contributions. Funding for this work was provided by a University of Calgary Teaching and Learning Grant.

## Introduction

The behavioural neuroscience laboratory manual is very much a working document. Our aim is to provide an online resource comprised of suggested laboratory activities, each of which includes relevant background information, access to online resources, and clearly defined class learning outcomes. Alongside each activity are suggested student assignments and detailed rubrics outlining expectations and assessment approaches. Each laboratory exists independently such that users can select the modules that best align with their course offering. As an open access document, our laboratory manual allows users to suggest/update educational materials, assuring that course content and student assessment techniques remain current with best pedagogical practices. 

In its current iteration the behavioural neuroscience manual is focused on an exploration of rodent behaviour \(specifically the Sprague Dawley rat\). Major themes include movement, learning and memory, fear and anxiety, mating and maternal behaviour, and several pathological states such as stroke and Parkinsonâ€™s disease.

Each laboratory activity includes clearly stated learning outcomes, an introduction designed to provide background information and context, and a detailed list of relevant procedures. Where possible supplementary material has been made available in the form of embedded videos or links to additional online resources.

Paired with laboratory activities are a variety of suggested assessments; these range from two to three page brief assignments to full-length laboratory reports. Included with each assessment is a rubric that clearly outlines grading breakdown.

An in-depth appendix includes information relevant to the course \(detailed surgical procedures\), as well as an example laboratory report rubric, and an article discussing how to approach a manuscript-style lab report.

All files are maintained on [GitHub](https://github.com/jmonc/BNLM), and this online manual is generated using [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com). Gitbook provides easy access and edit-ability to our content. Stay tuned for future updates!
