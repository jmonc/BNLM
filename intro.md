# Behavioural Neuroscience Lab Manual

## Welcome

This is an open access project from the University of Calgary, aiming to provide the resources collected from the PSYC 478 behavioural neuroscience course to students and instructors around the world.

## Introduction



The laboratory exercises provide an introduction to experimental approaches, neural mechanisms, and the health implications from neurological behaviour. 

Currently, the content introduces new students to animal handling for mice, before covering both normal and abnormal behaviour. After each lab, suggested homework is provided. In depth lab report assignments are also provided. 

Finally guides to writing manuscript-style lab reports, scoring rubrics and guides to surgeries are included  in the appendix.

This is the initial structure, but we hope to increase both the scope and resources provided.

All files are maintained on [GitHub](https://github.com/jmonc/BNLM). This online manual is generated using [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com). Gitbook provides easy access and edit-ability to the content. In future updates, easy to use download links will be provided so that individual chapter pdfs and modifiable .doc files may be accessed.

In the mean time, the repository on GitHub has the full pdf format of this work as well as the master word document. Simply follow the following link and follow the instructions to access this information.
