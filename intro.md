# Behavioural Neuroscience Lab Manual

## Welcome

This is an open access project created at the University of Calgary, with the goal of providing an online resource for a senior-level behavioural neuroscience laboratory course \(PSYC 478\). Included in the document are a number of laboratory activities and suggested student assessments.

The authors are indebted to those that have contributed to and provided feedback on several versions of the laboratory manual. Specifically we would like to acknowledge Dr. Brooke Rakai and Dr. Cam Teskey for their contributions. Funding for this work was provided by a University of Calgary Teaching and Learning Grant.

## Introduction

The behavioural neuroscience laboratory manual is very much a working document. Our aim is to provide an online resource comprised of suggested laboratory activities, each of which includes relevant background information, access to online resources, and clearly defined class learning outcomes. Alongside each activity are suggested student assignments and detailed rubrics outlining expectations and assessment approaches. Each laboratory exists independently such that users can select the modules that best align with their course offering. As an open access document, our laboratory manual allows users to suggest/update educational materials, assuring that course content and student assessment techniques remain current with best pedagogical practices. 

In its current iteration the behavioural neuroscience manual is focused on exposing students to rodent behaviour \(specifically the Sprague Dawley rat\). Major themes include movement, learning and memory, fear and anxiety, mating and maternal behaviour, and several pathological states such as stroke and Parkinsonâ€™s disease.

Finally guides to writing manuscript-style lab reports, scoring rubrics and guides to surgeries are included  in the appendix.

This is the initial structure, but we hope to increase both the scope and resources provided.

All files are maintained on [GitHub](https://github.com/jmonc/BNLM). This online manual is generated using [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com). Gitbook provides easy access and edit-ability to the content. In future updates, easy to use download links will be provided so that individual chapter pdfs and modifiable .doc files may be accessed.

In the mean time, the repository on GitHub has the full pdf format of this work as well as the master word document. Simply follow the following link and follow the instructions to access this information.
